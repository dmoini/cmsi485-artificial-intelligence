Selected programs from CMSI 485: Artificial Intelligence course at Loyola Marymount University

- **homework-1**: Implemented A* graph search on a non-uniform cost maze pathfinding formulation of the traveling salesman problem.
- **homework-2a**: Implemented a basic propositional logic inference engine.
- **homework-3**: Created a decision-network-based Ad Agent that maximizes sales by selecting an advertisement to show based on the user's collected demographic data.
